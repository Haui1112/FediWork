FediWork is a free (as in free speech) and open source employment seeking platform. It is supposed to be an alternative to LinkedIn, Xing, Stepstone and other corporate walled garden job platforms.

This project has been forked from Mastodon because License, Backend and AP protocol are so far the best I could find. I'm also not a fan of reinventing the wheel if the wheel is democratic.

## If you want to know what mastodon is:

Mastodon is a **free, open-source social network server** based on ActivityPub where users can follow friends and discover new ones. On Mastodon, users can publish anything they want: links, pictures, text, and video. All Mastodon servers are interoperable as a federated network (users on one server can seamlessly communicate with users from another one, including non-Mastodon software that implements ActivityPub!)

The original repository is https://github.com/mastodon/mastodon

Both the original and this fork are licensed under [AGPL](LICENSE)

## What makes this Project unique?

This project is supposed to democratize (as in direct democracy, not "democracy") job platforms by making them federated.

So far, the project is in its infancy and will be for some time in the future. The planned (unique) features so far are:

- Encrypted personal data (clear name, address, places of work, exact employment dates, phone number and email adress)
- (possibly) p2p transfer of the encrypted dataset to a potential employer
- wide range of fields in the profile such as a blog style work experience section (workplace1, workplace2, etc.) and a list of skills
- filter or matching for employers to find suitable candidates and job seekers to find suitable employers
- absolutely no pay2win, so employers cant buy their way to the candidate. They need to get upvotes or match the search terms
- obviously no "ads" aside from the job postings, which can be reported if they are discriminatory or false
- (possibly) auto delete function for cv data if no agreement is reached after sending it
- interoperability with other AP services and possibly cross employment offers (depending on the technical capabilities of the client)
- Job offers require a verified link (and possibly the verified link is manually checked after)

## Why do we need a federated Job platform?
Because we have a tremendous shortage of honesty in our current job platforms. Depending on the country, the government agencies are not equipped to handle the modern job market and the private platforms are rigged towards extracting money from both the company (fair, imo) and the candidate. People are encouraged to pay fees to get ahead in the job race, which creates very negative tendencies on current job platforms.

Memes like this one are very accurate imo:

A federated version could make it so positive interaction with employers and other job seekers gets you up. Like forwarding a job offer that doesnt fit you to someone who you think fits. If they match, even better.

Enough rambling, I'm not a pro dev so this will probably take a long time and I need to learn a lot. Feel free to help with whatever you like.

Thank you very much for reading and have a great day.
